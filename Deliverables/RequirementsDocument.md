# Stories and personas

## Alice
Alice is a 53 years old housewife with a very numerous family. She always takes care of the food shopping for the whole family and really enjoys being rewarded with prizes the more shopping she does. Alice is very impatient and although she buys a lot of goods, she cannot bare waiting for too long at the cashier.
Alice usually goes to the food shop twice a week and gets really mad when she does not find the goods she is looking for on the shelves, sometimes when she does not manage to find a product she usually buys, she just gets out the shop and goes somewhere else.

## Caroline
Caroline is a 31 years old woman, she works at the shop as a cashier and she's always in direct contact with customers. For this reason, she is in charge of accounting the cash desk. Caroline is married and has two children so she doesn't want to stay much longer at the shop after the closing time: she wants to quickly account the cash desk and get back to her children.
In a typically working day, Caroline has to sell many products to people and she expect to have a fast calculation of the total amount of money spent from the customers. She has to ask customers for fidelity card and she also manages cashes and credit cards.
Caroline noticed that sometimes customers ask her to remove or change a product from the transaction, since they changed idea. For this reason, Caroline is interrupted and has to remove the item from the receipt.

## Stefano
Stefano is 35 years old man with professional knowledge about business, administration and operation management. He is a very organized person and is currently focused on his job because he is the owner of EZShop and he is in charge of Accounting Manager, Customers Manager and Inventory Manager.
During the working day, he wakes up at 7 am and goes directly to work after breakfast. Since he is such a responsible man, he likes to arrive earlier than the rest. After some time, he starts doing his job which consists in several actions, such as checking all the products in the inventory, manages customers' information and does accounting for incomes and expenses happening during the day. 
Stefano has high hopes about the new software that is going to be applied to the food shop, since he believes that technology is mandatory to have an optimized system of inventory and sales, and then obtain better results in terms of economic growth and organization.
